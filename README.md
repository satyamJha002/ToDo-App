# ToDo-App

A list of the tasks that you have to do, or things that you want to do: Each day I try to mark off as many items on my to-do list as possible.

# Goal of Project
The goal of this project is to create a ToDo List web application using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. The application will allow users to create and view tasks. 

# Features
1. Users should be able to create new tasks.

2. Users should be able to view a list of all their tasks.

3. Users should be able to strike through their completed tasks in the to-do list. Tasks do not need to be deleted.

4.  Users should be able to access at least 2 lists, one for the day's tasks and another for their work-related tasks.

3.  The application should be well-styled and responsive, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

# Technical Requirements
1. Node.js & Express.js: The application will be a web server built using Node.js and Express.js. Express.js will handle routing and middleware.

2. EJS: EJS will be used as the templating engine to generate dynamic HTML based on the application's state.
